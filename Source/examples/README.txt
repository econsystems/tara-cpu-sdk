1. Applications					-	This folder contains applications using the disparity 
									obtained from stereo camera Tara.
	
	I) FaceDetection			-	Detects the face in both the left and right images using LBP
									Cascade Classifier of OpenCV.
									The Point from the face after detection is converted to a 3D 
									point and the depth of the person from the camera is displayed.

	II) HeightEstimation

		a) HeightCalibration	-	This is used for calibrating the height of the base from the 
									camera. 
                                    The base is determined by averaging(minimum of 10 frames) the
									depth of a point selected by a user on the disparity map.
	                                The depth calculated is written to the file named "BaseHeight" 
									and placed under the folder named "Height" which is used by the
									height estimation to determine the height.
	
		b) HeightEstimation		-   The Height of the person standing under the camera is estimated
									with the reference to the "BaseHeight" file generated by the
									HeightCalibration project.
	                                The Height of the person is actually selected by scanning the 
									depth in the 1/3 of the disparity map. The lowest depth is 
									selected as the depth of the head.
	                                The Head depth is subtracted from the base depth and the height
									of the person is displayed.
									
	IV) VolumeCalculation		-	The volume of a box in the scene is estimated.

2. IMU							-   A window with three circles denoting the three axis is created. 
									The circles are rotated based on the rotation of the device.

3. PointCloud					-	Point Cloud view of the scene is displayed.

4. README						-	This file (you are reading now!!)

5. Samples						-   Contains few samples using the SDK.

	I) TaraCamViewer			-	This is the sample to access the camera in the OpenCV. Rectified 
									images of both the left and the right camera is displayed.

	II) TaraDepthViewer			-	Rectified images of both the left and the right camera is
									displayed.
									Disparity Map is displayed, depth of the point selected by the
									user is shown.
	
	III) TaraDisparityViewer	-   Disparity along with the left and right images are displayed.
	
	
Note :
	Before trying to build the applications, Make sure the configure shell script in the Source directory has run atleast once in your system. To run the applications, the libs placed in the common folder should be built prior in order to link with the applications.
